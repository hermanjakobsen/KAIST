Achieve better average best fitness and better average generation for obtaining optimal solution
by setting PXOVER=0.25 and PMUTATION=0.10. So the new parameters give a better performance for problem 2.
Does the parameters give a better performance for all the problems abd selection methods?
Probably not...
